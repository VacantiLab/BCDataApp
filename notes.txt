- fix key errors when selecting a gene not in mRNA but in protein data set or vise-versa.
-     have blank data displayed in the set that does not have the gene
-     some genes, like GSE1, do not appear to be in either set. Why are they there?
- the x-axis cannot have the same entry twice on the subtype plot.
-     could be problematic with multiple blank entries

Cleaning up code prior to adding metabolic subgroup protein plot
- import the update_prot_trace functions.
-     each function needs access to main.py's global variables
-         I believe this can be accomplished by importing main in each function and accessing the variables as main.variable
- set gene = new in the update_prot_trace functions
