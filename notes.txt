- fix key errors when selecting a gene not in mRNA but in protein data set or vise-versa.
-     have blank data displayed in the set that does not have the gene
-     some genes, like GSE1, do not appear to be in either set. Why are they there?
- the x-axis cannot have the same entry twice on the subtype plot.
-     could be problematic with multiple blank entries

- Have the subtype plot start with a different set of genes
- Have the dropdown menus all start with "Select"
